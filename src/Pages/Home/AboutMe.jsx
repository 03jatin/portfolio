                    <p className="hero--section--description">I'm pursuing BBA with specialization in Financial Technology. Recent worked as an intern as Community Manager where I focus on building amazing teams and quickly adapting to new learnings.</p>
                    <p className="hero--section--description">As Human Beings are outnumbered by internet so to manage it all and dig into customer problems, I'm upskilling myself with Computer Programming Languages. and also I love applying responsive design principles, so I cultivated my time in UX Design too. Apart from this I had worked in an NGO which made me more disciplined  and as a entry level position this was a good experience as I had learnt how to work as a team and how to manage time.</p>
